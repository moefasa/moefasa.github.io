### My website

Hi! I made this website to host some of the R projects I’ve been working on. As of 03/04/17 I have some of the progress on the UB crime project, but I’m also involved in my 2nd Kaggle competition where I’m using data from RentHop to predict user interest level on their rental posts.

I’ll be updating and adding markdown pages as I go.

### A bit about me

Not long ago I was a mechanical engineer designing pharmaceutical and healthcare facilities. I loved what I did and was great at it, but I was always frustrated about how buildings were designed and operated. Buildings had all this data, but they were just so dumb!

So I did some research on ways to make the process smarter, and that’s when I learned about machine learning, and I fell in love! I started coming up with ways to solve some of the problems I was facing at work, but there was only so much I could do in my spare time.

Realizing that I would probably not want to design an HVAC system just for kicks, but was doing ML projects in my spare time, I decided to leave my imminent 6-figure salary to go back to school in hopes of becoming a data scientist.

To summarize - I love to code, I love data, and I love solving real problems (oh, and I’m a big Star Trek fan).
